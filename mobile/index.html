          <p>The goal of the DIVD.works project is to create a platform that brings together young digital talent and employers. We help you not only further develop your skills but also find an internship or (part-time) job that suits you. Last week, we spoke with some of you about the struggles of studying and gaining work experience. <br> <br>Finding an internship – or later a graduation internship – turns out to be quite a challenge, causing more and more young people to give up. A shame, isn’t it? That’s why we want to build a platform that makes finding work and paid internships as easy as ordering a pizza via UberEats. No endless searches—just direct access to relevant opportunities and companies looking for your skills.</p>
