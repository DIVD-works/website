            <p>We want to address the wide-scale internship shortage by connecting students with meaningful, informative projects that lay the foundation for a successful career.</p>
            <p>We want to help students build a strong network of valuable connections that support their careers</p>
            <p>To give students the choice to either complete their required internships or take on real, rewarding workâ€”if they have the motivation, discipline, and passion to succeed. </p>
